def AdjustedCapacity_Constraint(M: 'TemoaModel', r, p, t, v):
    r"""
    This constraint updates the capacity of a process by taking into account retirements
    and end of life. For a given :code:`(r,p,t,v)` index, this constraint sets the capacity
    equal to the amount installed in period :code:`v` and subtracts from it any and all retirements
    that occurred prior to the period in question, :code:`p`, and end of life from the
    survival curve if defined. It finally adjusts for the process life fraction, which
    accounts for a possible mid-period end of life where, for example, EOL 3 years into a 5-year
    period would be treated as :math:`\frac{3}{5}` capacity for all 5 years.

        :width: 100%
        :figclass: align-center
        :figwidth: 50%

        For processes reaching end of life mid-period, the process life fraction adjustment is applied,
        distributing the effective capacity over the whole period.

    For processes using survival curves, the yearly survival curve :math:`\text{LSC}_{r,p,t,v}` is
    averaged over the period to get the effective remaining capacity for that period  Because this
    implicitly handles mid-period end of life, :math:`\text{PLF}_{r,p,t,v}` is used to account for both 
    phenomena.

        :figwidth: 50%

        For processes with a defined survival curve, the surviving capacity is averaged over each
        period to get the adjusted capacity. This implicitly handles mid-period end of life as a
        survival curve will always be zero after the end of life of a process.

    This constraint ensures that the capacity of a given process is sufficient
    to support its activity across all time periods and time slices. The calculation
    on the left hand side of the equality is the maximum amount of energy a process
    can produce in the timeslice :code:`(s,d)`. Note that the curtailment variable
    shown below only applies to technologies that are members of the curtailment set.
    Curtailment is necessary to track explicitly in scenarios that include a high
    renewable target. Without it, the model can generate more activity than is used
    to meet demand, and have all activity (including the portion curtailed) count
    towards the target. Tracking activity and curtailment separately prevents this

    Using the :code:`FlowOut` and :code:`Capacity` variables, the Temoa objective
    function calculates the cost of energy supply, under the assumption that capital
    costs are paid through loans. This implementation sums up all the costs incurred,
    and is defined as :math:`C_{tot} = C_{loans} + C_{fixed} + C_{variable} + C_{emissions}`.
    Each term on the right-hand side represents the cost incurred over the model
    time horizon and discounted to the initial year in the horizon (:math:`{P}_0`).
    The calculation of each term is given below.

        \end{aligned}

    Note that capital costs (:math:`{CI}_{r,t,v}`) are handled in several steps.
    
        1. Each capital cost is amortized using the loan rate (i.e., technology-specific discount rate) and loan period.

        2. The annual stream of payments is converted into a lump sum using the global discount rate and loan period.

        3. The new lump sum is amortized at the global discount rate over the process lifetime.

        4. Loan payments beyond the model time horizon are removed and the lump sum recalculated.

        5. Finally, the lump sum is discounted back to the beginning of the horizon (:math:`P_0`) using the global discount rate.
    
    Steps 3 and 4 serve to correctly balance the cost-benefit of technologies whose useful lives
    would extend beyond the planning horizon. While an explicit salvage term is not included, this approach properly
    captures the capital costs incurred within the model time horizon, accounting for process-specific loan rates
    and periods.

    In the case of processes using survival curves, steps 3 and 4 do not reamortise costs uniformly over the process lifetime.
    Instead, costs are amortised over the life of the process in proportion to the survival fraction in each year.
    Note that, for this calculation, a survival curve :math:`{LSC}_{r,y,t,v}` must be defined out to the year in which the
    surviving fraction is zero, even if that extends beyond the planning horizon. It must also be defined for each integer
    year between model periods and, if not, these gaps will be filled by linear interpolation ahead of this calculation.

            C_{loans,LSC} =& \sum_{r, t, v \in \Theta_{CI}} CI_{r, t, v} \cdot \textbf{NCAP}_{r, t, v}

    Fixed, variable, and emissions annual cost factors are determined by:

    The Demand constraint drives the model.  This constraint ensures that supply at
    least meets the demand specified by the Demand parameter in all periods and
    slices, by ensuring that the sum of all the demand output commodity (:math:`c`)
    generated by both commodity flow at the time slice level (:math:`\textbf{FO}`) and
    the annual level (:math:`\textbf{FOA}`) must meet the modeler-specified demand
    in each time slice.

    Note that the validity of this constraint relies on the fact that the
    :math:`C^d` set is distinct from both :math:`C^e` and :math:`C^p`. In other
    words, an end-use demand must only be an end-use demand.  Note that if an output
    could satisfy both an end-use and internal system demand, then the output from

#     should be used throughout the year.  Without this constraint, the model might choose
#     to only use the electric furnace during the day, and the natural gas furnace during the
#     night.

#     This constraint ensures that the ratio of a process activity to demand is
#     constant for all time slices.  Note that if a demand is not specified in a given

def CommodityBalance_Constraint(M: 'TemoaModel', r, p, s, d, c):
    r"""
    Where the Demand constraint :eq:`Demand` ensures that end-use demands are met,
    the CommodityBalance constraint ensures that the endogenous system demands are
    met.  This constraint requires the total production of a given commodity
    to equal the amount consumed, thus ensuring an energy balance at the system
    level. In this most general form of the constraint, the energy commodity being
    balanced has variable production at the time slice level. The energy commodity
    can then be consumed by three types of processes: storage technologies, non-storage
    technologies with output that varies at the time slice level, and non-storage
    technologies with constant annual output.

    Separate expressions are required in order to account for the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` by downstream processes. For the commodity flow into storage
    technologies, we use :math:`\textbf{FI}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`. Note that the FlowIn
    variable is defined only for storage technologies, and is required because storage
    technologies balance production and consumption across time slices rather than
    within a single time slice. For commodity flows into non-storage processes with time
    varying output, we use :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}/EFF_{r, i,t,v,o}`.
    The division by :math:`EFF_{r, c,t,v,o}` is applied to the output flows that consume
    commodity :math:`c` to determine input flows. Finally, we need to account
    for the consumption of commodity :math:`c` by the processes in
    :code:`tech_annual`. Since the commodity flow of these processes is on an
    annual basis, we use :math:`SEG_{s,d}` to calculate the consumption of
    commodity :math:`c` in time-slice :math:`(s,d)` from the annual flows.
    Formulating an expression for the production of commodity :math:`c` is
    more straightforward, and is simply calculated by
    :math:`\textbf{FO}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`.

    In some cases, the overproduction of a commodity may be required, such
    that the supply exceeds the endogenous demand. Refineries represent a
    common example, where the share of different refined products are governed
    by TechOutputSplit, but total production is driven by a particular commodity
    like gasoline. Such a situation can result in the overproduction of other
    refined products, such as diesel or kerosene. In such cases, we need to
    track the excess production of these commodities. To do so, the technology
    producing the excess commodity should be added to the :code:`tech_flex` set.
    This flexible technology designation will activate a slack variable
    (:math:`\textbf{FLX}_{r, p, s, d, i, t, v, c}`) representing
    the excess production in the :code:`CommodityBalanceAnnual_Constraint`. Note
    that the :code:`tech_flex` set is different from :code:`tech_curtailment` set;
    the latter is technology- rather than commodity-focused and is used in the
    :code:`Capacity_Constraint` to track output that is used to produce useful
    output and the amount curtailed, and to ensure that the installed capacity
    covers both. Alternatively, the commodity can be added to the
    :code:`commodity_waste` set, for which this equality constraint becomes an
    inequality constraint, allowing production to exceed consumption for a single
    commodity.

    This constraint also accounts for imports and exports between regions
    when solving multi-regional systems. The import (:math:`\textbf{FIM}`) and export
    (:math:`\textbf{FEX}`) variables are created on-the-fly by summing the
    :math:`\textbf{FO}` variables over the appropriate import and export regions,
    respectively, which are defined in :code:`temoa_initialize.py` by parsing the
    :code:`tech_exchange` processes.

    Consumption of the commodity by construction inputs is annualised using the period
    length. Production of the commodity by end-of-life outputs uses the AnnualRetirement
    variable, which is already annualised.

    Finally, for annual commodities, AnnualCommodityBalance is used which balances
    the sum of flows over each year.

    *process outputs + imports + end of life outputs = process inputs + construction inputs + exports + flex waste*

    This constraint ensures that the amount of energy stored does not exceed
    the upper bound set by the energy capacity of the storage device, as calculated
    on the right-hand side.

    Because the number and duration of time slices are user-defined, we need to adjust
    the storage duration, which is specified in hours. First, the hourly duration is divided
    by the number of hours in a year to obtain the duration as a fraction of the year.
    Since the :math:`C2A` parameter assumes the conversion of capacity to annual activity,
    we need to express the storage duration as fraction of a year. Then, :math:`SEG_{s,d}`
    summed over the time-of-day slices (:math:`d`) multiplied by :math:`DPP` yields the
    number of days per season. This step is necessary because conventional time sliced models
    use a single day to represent many days within a given season. Thus, it is necessary to
    scale the storage duration to account for the number of days in each season.

    Unlike non-seasonal (daily) storage, seasonal storage is allowed to carry energy
    between seasons. However, through seasons representing multiple days, many days' 
    charge deltas have accumulated, multiplied by the number of days the season
    represents. If we allowed these stacked deltas to carry between seasons then we would
    be multiplying the effective energy capacity of the storage. We could just constrain
    the seasonal delta to the unadjusted energy capacity, but then the final day in the
    season would sit atop a season's worth of deltas, possibly exceeding our upper or
    lower bound by a factor of :math:`\frac{N-1}{N}` where :math:`N` is the number of
    days the sequential season represents.

        The energy upper bound or non-negative lower bound could be violated in a
        season representing multiple days if we both adjusted the upper bound to
        the number of days and allowed a seasonal delta.

    So, we do not adjust the upper energy bound for seasonal storage. This limits the
    ability of seasonal storage to perform arbitrage within each season, but allows it to
    carry energy between seasons realistically.

    A modeler can track emissions through use of the :code:`commodity_emissions`
    set and :code:`EmissionActivity` parameter.  The :math:`EAC` parameter is
    analogous to the efficiency table, tying emissions to a unit of activity.  The
    LimitEmission constraint allows the modeler to assign an upper bound per period
    to each emission commodity. Note that this constraint sums emissions from
    technologies with output varying at the time slice and those with constant annual
    output in separate terms.

    r"""

    Some processes take a single input and make multiple outputs, and the user would like to
    specify either a constant or time-varying ratio of outputs per unit input.  The most
    canonical example is an oil refinery.  Crude oil is used to produce many different refined
    products. In many cases, the modeler would like to limit the share of each refined
    product produced by the refinery.

    For example, a hypothetical (and highly simplified) refinery might have a crude oil input
    that produces 4 parts diesel, 3 parts gasoline, and 2 parts kerosene.  The relative
    ratios to the output then are:

    .. math::

       d = \tfrac{4}{9} \cdot \text{total output}, \qquad
       g = \tfrac{3}{9} \cdot \text{total output}, \qquad
       k = \tfrac{2}{9} \cdot \text{total output}

    Note that it is possible to specify output shares that sum to less than unity. In such
    cases, the model optimizes the remaining share. In addition, it is possible to change the
    specified shares by model time period. Under this constraint, only the
    technologies with variable output at the timeslice level (i.e., NOT in the
    :code:`tech_annual` set) are considered.

    The constraint is formulated as follows:
